# Citizen Grievance Management System (CGMS)

## Problem Statement

Local government departments receive high volumes of citizen grievances (water supply, electricity outages, road damage, sanitation, etc.) that are logged through manual or siloed systems. This leads to delayed responses, unclear ownership, and a lack of transparency. The proposed project will develop a Salesforce-based solution to centralize complaint submission, automate routing, and provide management dashboards for efficient tracking and resolution.
